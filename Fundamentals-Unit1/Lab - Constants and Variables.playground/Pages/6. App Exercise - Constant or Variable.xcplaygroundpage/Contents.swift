/*:
## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
- Name: The user's name
- Age: The user's age
- Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
- Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
- Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours
 */
let name = "Riccardo" /// User 's name do not change, so it's constant.
var age = 27 /// The age changes year by year, so it should be a variable.
var todaySteps = 2000 /// The number of steps changes at each user's step, so it must be variable.
let goalSteps = 10000 /// Goal steps is a constant which not change during time.
var averageHeartRate = 90 /// The average heart rate changes over time, so it has to be a constant.
/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
