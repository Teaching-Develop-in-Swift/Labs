## App Exercise - Workout Extensions

 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.

 Add an extension to the `Workout` struct below and make it adopt the `CustomStringConvertible` protocol.

extension Workout {

    }

//:  Now add a method `harderWorkout` that takes no parameters and returns another `Workout` instance. This method should double the `distance` and `time` properties, and add 40 to `averageHR`. Create an instance of `Workout` and print it to the console. Then call `harderWorkout` and print the new `Workout` instance to the console.
