## Exercise - Collection Functions

 Using the code below, use the `map` function to create an array of `Int` values, whose values are equal to the original integer value, plus 1. Use `$0` as you iterate through the values of the array. Print the resulting collection.

//:  Using the code below, use the `filter` function to create a new array of `String` values. The new array should only include Strings longer than four characters. Use `$0` as you iterate through the values of the array.  Print the resulting collection.
let schoolSubjects = ["Math", "Computer Science", "Gym", "English", "Biology"]
let filter = schoolSubjects.filter({$0.count > 4})

//:  Using the code below, use the `reduce` function to subtract all of the values within the array from the starting value 100. Print the resulting value.
