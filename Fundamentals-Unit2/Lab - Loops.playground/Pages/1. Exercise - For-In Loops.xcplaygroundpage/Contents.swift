//:  Create a for-in loop that loops through each of the characters in the `alphabet` string below, and prints each of the values alongside the index.
let alphabet = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"

//:  Create a `[String: String]` dictionary, where the keys are names of states and the values are their capitals. Include at least three key/value pairs in your collection, then use a for-in loop to iterate over the pairs and print out the keys and values in a sentence.
let dic : [String : String] = ["TÃ¼rkiye" : "Ankara", "Italiy": "Rome"]

for (key, value) in dic{
    print("\(key) -> \(value)")
