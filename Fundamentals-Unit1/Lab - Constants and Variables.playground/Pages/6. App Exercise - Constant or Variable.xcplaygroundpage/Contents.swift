## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
- Name: The user's name
- Age: The user's age
- Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
- Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
- Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours
 */
let name = "Thiti"
print("Name is not change, it should be constant")
var age = 42
print("Age is an inherently variable trait.")
var numberOfStep = 5000
print("Number of steps will change all time when user moving, It will be a variable")
let goalStep = 10000
print("User need to config the value of goal only once to use as a daily step goal")
var avgHeartRate = 60
print("Average heart rate will be updated based on current heart rate, it can change every second.")
/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
